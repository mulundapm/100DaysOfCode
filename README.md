  <summary>Day 2 : 24 May (Friday)</summary>
  Time spent: 3.5h
  
  1. Started on the capstone module of Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate
  2. Learned how to make a drop-down component with animation in figma
  3. Learned how to secure an api key on an open repo
  4. Started on making a convertor without tutorial. stopped after all currency loaded as an option

Thought: Slow progress today. Hiding api keys seems very complicated yesterday but turns out its pretty straight forward. Got scared by all those long reddits post on this topic.

  <summary>Day 3 : 25 May (Saturday)</summary>
  Time spent: 6h
  
  1. Continued on course 8/9 of Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate
  2. Started on a restaurant reservation react app as my capstone project, created half of the home page
  3. Completed a vanilla js currency convertor without tutorial
  4. Struggled a bit with setting up new repo and git for the project
