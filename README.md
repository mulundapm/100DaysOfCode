  5. Joined #100daysofcode on discord
  6. Watch a couple youtube videos on local hosting (not that i am going to do it anytime soon or ever)

Thought: Have been sick for a few days now but all of sudden have this burst of energy working on programming, very hyped right now. Was suppose to sleep at 10 and here i am, editing my challenge readme at 1 am. Im really enjoying this.

  <summary>Day 2 : 24 May (Friday)</summary>
  Time spent: 3.5h
  
  1. Started on the capstone module of Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate
  2. Learned how to make a drop-down component with animation in figma
  3. Learned how to secure an api key on an open repo
  4. Started on making a convertor without tutorial. stopped after all currency loaded as an option

Thought: Slow progress today. Hiding api keys seems very complicated yesterday but turns out its pretty straight forward. Got scared by all those long reddits post on this topic.

<details>
  <summary>Day 3 : 25 May (Saturday)</summary>
  Time spent: 4.5h
  
  1. Continued on course 8/9 of Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate
  2. Started on a [restaurant reservation react app](https://github.com/mulundapm/restaurant-booking) as my course capstone project, created half of the home page
  3. Completed a vanilla js currency convertor without tutorial
  4. Struggled a bit with setting up new repo and git for the project

Thought: Coded the whole day without watching tutorial to pratise my googling skills, went pretty well. Putting focus on writing css today for the first time, not as itimidating as I thought itd be.

<details>
  <summary>Day 4 : 26 May (Sunday)</summary>
  Time spent: 5.5h
  
  1. Continued on a [restaurant reservation react app](https://github.com/mulundapm/restaurant-booking), completed the pages set up and the states of input, will be working on context next to share data between pages
  2. Learned more about dom manipulation

Thought: Spent a lot of time googling and fixing errors today since im new in working with states, ngl, was pretty frustrated at some points but getting through these is what makes the difference.

<details>
  <summary>Day 5 : 27 May (Monday)</summary>
  Time spent: 1.25h
  
  Continued on a [restaurant reservation react app](https://github.com/mulundapm/restaurant-booking)
    
  -used useLocation and useNavigate hook to share states between pages

Thought: Was hoping to use context api to share states between booking and confirmation page but got stuck. Chatgpt suggested using useLocation and useNavigate, it seems simple so i went for it. Boy was I wrong for that. When done, not quite satisfied since the states are not global. Will be investing more time next time to do research and rewrite this using context api.

<details>
  <summary>Day 6 : 28 May (Tuesday)</summary>
  Time spent: 2h
  
  Continued on a [restaurant reservation react app](https://github.com/mulundapm/restaurant-booking)
    
  -used context api to pass states

Thought: have to do more practise on context api since still not comfortable with it. Spent 30min+ on error "React Router: Cannot read property 'pathname' of undefined". Turns out it matters on the order of BrowserRouter import - Router, Routes, Route. Something so minor yet critical with a terrible error message.. :)
